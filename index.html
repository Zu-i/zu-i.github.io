      <h1 class="red">Who are you?</h1>
      <p>
        Hoi, I'm <span class="mm-3">Zu</span> / <span class="mm-3">Xionme</span> / <span class="mm-3" title="old username">Toxin</span>.
      </p>
      <h1 class="orange">What do you do?</h1>
      <p>
        I mainly just code stuff, play games and listen to music.<br>
        I'm staff in <a class="mm-3" href="https://discord.gg/recover">recover</a> and overseer in <a class="mm-3" href="#urafurrynow" title="not public">Abyssal</a>.

      <h1 class="yellow">That's it??<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/968257397552468028.png?size=16" alt="bruh" title="bruh"></h1>
      <p>
        I'm a <span class="mm-3">furry</span>, <span class="mm-3">introvert</span> and <span class="mm-3">nerd</span>.
        I love sci-fi movies and books,
        My main coding languages are <span class="mm-3">Javascript</span> and <span class="mm-3">Python</span> as I mainly do back-end and SUCK at front-end, hence this lmao.
        I like making utilites to make hard things easier for non-techy people, my favourite music genres are <span class="mm-3">EDM</span> (<span class="mm-3">dubstep</span>, <span class="mm-3">lofi</span>, etc)
        I easily spend a majority of my time just watching youtube or learning new random skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favourite games are <span class="mm-3">Starbound</span>, <span class="mm-3">Stardew Valley</span>, <span class="mm-3">Minecraft</span>, <span class="mm-3">Factorio</span> and <span class="mm-3">Skyrim</span> and I play <span class="mm-3">Starbound</span> faaaaarr too much. <span style="color:#444">(but I have nobody to play with, pls dm)</span>
        Anyways, about me personally- my pronouns are <span class="mm-3">he</span>/<span class="mm-3">they</span>, as for my sexuality- <span class="mm-3">demisexual</span>, I'm taken.
      </p>
      <h1 class="green">Things you don't like?</h1>
      <p>
        honestly, random friend requests, toxic or bigoted people and anyone *phobic or that believes in stupid stuff ;)<br>big dislike for people who think they're better than others.
      </p>
      <h1 class="blue">Anything else?</h1>
      <p id="torep">
        My current time is <span id="currenttime" class="mm-3">idk, js disabled</span>, I'm usually awake from 6am - 10pm.<br>
        You won't find me online, prior to updating this page I've quite literally purged everything I could from the internet about myself irl, anything you do find was likely put there just to mess with you for trying.<br>
        I mainly use windows 11 as of 2023, big fan of <span class="mm-3">arch</span> and <span class="mm-3">i3wm</span> though.<br>
        I'm uhh, well I'm esoteric, I tend to adapt fast.<br>
        <span class="mm-3" title="thought it looked easier to read if I just gave main topics">i liek reinbow</span>
